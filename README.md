# Corona_Lung


In this Project i worked with data regarding ***COVID-19***, it is with nearly 200 - 300 images and i convertd into the ***CSV*** file then we trained with ***CNN*** forthe classification

### Classes of Images 

1. [COVID](https://github.com/saichandrareddy1/Corona_Lung/blob/master/Images/corona.jpg)
2. [Normal](https://github.com/saichandrareddy1/Corona_Lung/blob/master/Images/normal.jpeg)


### Input and output

Input for the model with set of classes with **CSV file** (after running image to csv we can get that files) and output is the [Predicted images](https://github.com/saichandrareddy1/Corona_Lung/blob/master/Images/predicted.png)

![Predicted images](https://github.com/saichandrareddy1/Corona_Lung/blob/master/Images/predicted.png)

### Accuracy for the Model

we are passed with 0.967 and sensitivity 1.00 and specificity 0.944
